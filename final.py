"""
The program is looking to create a function that will calculate the perecent of grades
that are above that average score
The program is going to open file "final(1).txt"
It will then calculate the percentage of grades that are above average
it will gather all the grades from the file "final(1).txt"
it will add all grades and then calculate the average grade score
it will return the count and multiply the count by 100 then divide by the count of grades

The program will define a main function to kick start the next series 
it wil open the file and set grades to a empty list which will be imported from the file "final(1).txt"
it will append the grades and then print the number of grades
next the average is set to 0 so that it can be calculated
the average score is then divided by the count of grades to check how many grades are above average
the percent of grades that are above average is then calculated
print to the user the average grade score
print to the user the percent of grades that are above average
close the file
